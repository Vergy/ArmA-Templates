Your mod folder should be structured in a way that is easy to use and functions properly

e.g. - @XYZ_your_mod_pbo\abc_mod_name\files go here

config.cpp, cfgPatches.hpp, cfgMods.hpp, cfgVehicles.hpp, cfgWeapons.hpp, cfgUnitInsignia.hpp all go in the abc_mod_name folder.
Within the abc_mod_name folder you should organize your assets (models, images, scripts) within separate folders.

File types should include the full path name from the root folder indicated with a \ followed by the full path and ending with the file type.
eg. hiddenSelectionsTextures[] = "\abc_mod_name\image_folder\icon.paa";
