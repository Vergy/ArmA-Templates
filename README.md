This repository is a collection of templates that I have created in the process of making my own assets for Arma 3. If you have not seen my video on how to properly and efficently use this repository check out my youtube channel at [YouTube.com/Ma77h3hac83r](http://youtube.com/ma77h3hac83r).

There are two main folders. One is a collection of photoshop templates and the second is a list of config file templates for easy copy & pasting of dozens of lines of code to create new items with just a few clicks.

This repository will be updated regularly so check back often to see if anything new has shown up. I will try and keep things as close to how they appear in-game as far as names go but I have changed a few things for simplicity.

If anything is missing or incorrect or you wish for somehthing to be added create an [issue ](https://github.com/Ma77h3hac83r/ArmA-Templates/issues) and I will correct it when I can. This will not only ensure that I actually correct something but also that it keeps me motivated to fix things and add new things when I know people are using these resorces.
